# Process and Thread Manager

## Description
This project implements a system to manage processes and threads, including features like process creation/termination, thread pools, inter-process communication, and synchronization mechanisms. The system also addresses resource allocation, deadlock detection, and priority inheritance protocols to handle concurrency effectively.

## Features
- **Create/Manage Processes and Threads**: Supports creation and management of processes and threads.
- **Resource Allocation Tracking**: Keeps track of resource usage and allocation for processes and threads.
- **Deadlock Detection**: Implements basic mechanisms to detect deadlocks in the system.
- **Priority Inheritance Protocol**: Ensures that higher-priority threads are not blocked by lower-priority threads, maintaining proper system performance.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand process and thread states.
- Learn synchronization primitives and race conditions.
- Explore resource management techniques.
- Implement deadlock detection and priority management protocols.

## Build Instructions
To build and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Process-Thread-Manager.git
   cd Process-Thread-Manager
